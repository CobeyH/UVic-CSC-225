  # Assignment 1
  A convex hull is a polygon that encloses a set of points such that all its interior points lie within or on its boundary. It is a fundamental concept in computational geometry and has a wide range of applications, including image processing, geographic information systems, and robotics.
  In this assignment, students were tasked to create a program that would generate a convext hull for a provided set of points. The program is written in Java.
